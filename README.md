My name is Nirmalraj, aged 26, 27 this year. Born in the great capital city of Tamilnadu. I enjoy music a lot but I tend to be band oriented thus becoming a self-proclaimed band geek. Since I had no clue on what social life was all about in my adolescent years, ever
since the beginning of my adult life, that being the life after I  turned 17, I never partied or go clubbing, which to me is a total waste of time. I had more fun in front of my computer. In my leasure time i help my father in his business.
